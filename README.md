# Final Project for CS50P Course


## About the creater
Hi!! My Name is Abenezer Eshetie aka Ebenezer Eshexie. I am from Ethiopia, Eastern Africa. I am self-taught software developer and web designer. I am one of CS50 virtual student. I enjoy coding for fun but i have got to admit that this is my first time to code over 500 lines of codes. Yea. But the point is to apply most of thing i learn't about. It was fun. You have fun too by playing with the program. See you soon! :)

## What the program is
The program is multi-user enabled contact saver. With different user accounts, it can store as much contents as the user wants without user information colliding with eachother.

## How to use it
Hold on! Wait a minut.
1. Before anything, you need to install the required python packages for the program to run with out any error. The steps are as follows:
* Go to final project directory using _'cd'_ command.
* Run the following command _'pip install -r requirements.txt'_
* If you can go to requirements.txt and install eack packages one by one using the following command _'pip install [package]'_
2. Nice. Now you can run the program using the following command _'python final.py'_
3. You will be prompt for __User Name__. Just Input you User Name. Don't worry. The program will know that you are a new user and will prompt you if you want to create one.
* If you want to create new user, input _'y'_ or any of the following commands:
- _'1'_
- _'y'_
- _'yes'_
- _'k'_
- _'ok'_
- _'okay'_
- _'okey'_  in caps or non-caps or mixed
* Any key the is not in the above lists will abort the operation.
* Input you new user password
* Confirm the exact password you typed. Other wise you will be re-prompt if you want to create new user.
4. If you have already had user name, then when you input you user name, you will be asked for password. The program shuts dowm with 3 incorrect trial for the password.
5. Wow. you are in. Now you should see beautuful qoute to make your day. You should also see a promp waiting for you command. Go ahead and 
* Input - _'g'_ to go to your user dashboard.
* Input - _'e'_ to go to exit out of the program. Any key input other than this will make to re-prompt your for correct input.
6. If you went to dashboard, BOOOOM. You should see a penguin greeting you by your user name and list of the commands you can use.
* Input - _'u'_ to update an existing contact or create a new one. This is the first function you should do to enjoy other commands.
- Now you are prompt for more clear command. 
-- To update an existing contact, input _'e'_. Now you will be prompt for the name of contact and number. Enter accordingly. Oops. I forgot we don't have one. But try to put you contact's name. Not what you expected huh? The program will know that the contact by that name does not exist and will promp you if you want to create one. 
-- To create new contact,  input _'n'_. Now you will be prompt for the name of contact and number. Enter accordingly. What if you entered the contact that already exist? Will it override it? Try it. Got you again huh? The program will know that the contact by that name already exists and will promp you if you want to change the number of that contact.
-- This is not only how smart the program is. Okay try to create a new contact and input this _'1234f'_ when promp for Number. Haha. You should see the program rejecting you input saying _"you should only input numbers"_. Okay try this _'+1747474'_. It accepts you even though all you inputs are not numbers. THIS IS JUST A BEGINNENIG
